# Welcome to Your Expo App üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It is configured with **NativeWind** for styling, **TypeScript** for type safety, **FlashList** for performant lists, and **Expo Router** for file-based routing.

## üöÄ Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

3. **Start Developing**

   You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for file-based routing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

- **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)**: Utility-first CSS framework for React Native, enabling you to style components using Tailwind-like syntax.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and developer experience.
- **[FlashList](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/)**: A high-performance list component for React Native, optimized for smooth scrolling and large datasets.
- **[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)**: File-based routing for Expo apps, inspired by Next.js.

## üîÑ Reset the Project

When you're ready to start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
